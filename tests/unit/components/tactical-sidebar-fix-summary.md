# Tactical Sidebar Tests - Fix Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed the failing Tactical Sidebar test by resolving an element ambiguity issue. All 8 tests are now passing.

## Issue Identified
The test was failing due to multiple elements containing the same text "INFRASTRUCTURE":
1. **Sidebar Header**: `<h1>INFRASTRUCTURE</h1>` (the intended target)
2. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: `<a>INFRASTRUCTURE</a>` (unintended match)

## Error Details
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Found multiple elements with the text: INFRASTRUCTURE
```

The test was using `screen.getByText('INFRASTRUCTURE')` which returned multiple matches, causing the test to fail.

## Root Cause
The application has "INFRASTRUCTURE" text in two different locations:
- **Sidebar**: As a heading (`<h1>`) with tactical styling
- **Breadcrumb**: As a navigation link (`<a>`) in the top navigation bar

Both elements are legitimate parts of the UI, but the test needed to be more specific about which element it was targeting.

## Fix Applied

### Before (Ambiguous)
```typescript
// This would match both the h1 and the a element
expect(screen.getByText('INFRASTRUCTURE')).toBeInTheDocument()
const header = screen.getByText('INFRASTRUCTURE')
```

### After (Specific)
```typescript
// This specifically targets the h1 element using its semantic role
expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'INFRASTRUCTURE' })).toBeInTheDocument()
const header = screen.getByRole('heading', { name: 'INFRASTRUCTURE' })
```

## Solution Benefits

### 1. **Semantic Specificity**
- Uses `getByRole('heading')` to target the `<h1>` element specifically
- More semantically meaningful than generic text matching
- Aligns with accessibility best practices

### 2. **Test Reliability**
- Eliminates ambiguity between multiple elements with same text
- Makes the test more robust against UI changes
- Clearly expresses the test's intent

### 3. **Better Accessibility Testing**
- Tests that the heading has proper semantic markup
- Ensures the element is accessible to screen readers
- Validates proper heading hierarchy
