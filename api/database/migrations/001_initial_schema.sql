-- Initial schema migration
-- This migration is applied after the base schema.sql to demonstrate the migration system

-- Add any future schema changes here
-- For now, this is a placeholder migration to show the system works

-- Example: Add an index that might be needed later
-- CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_network_services_name ON network_services(name);

-- This migration doesn't change anything from the base schema
-- but demonstrates how future migrations would work
